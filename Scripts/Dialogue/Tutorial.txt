Hello John Dungeon, let me explain a few things:
You can left click to attack and right click to use your shield
You can use your shield to reflect certain projectiles
The Menu in the top right shows you how much stuff you have
You can press [Q] to use a bomb and [Tab] to use your potions
You can pick up coins to buy stuff...
However there is a limited amount so don't spend them all in one place
Keys can be used to unlock locked doors
Happy Dungeoning
